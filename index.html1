Rapeseed oil, also known more commonly as canola oil in the US, is a seed oil. It's made from the seeds of the rape plant, which is part of the cabbage and mustard family. You might have spotted the bright yellow flowers of the rape plant in large fields across the UK from the window of a train or a car on a journey through the countryside.

The seeds of the plant are pressed to create rapeseed oil. This process can be done at cold temperatures, known as cold-pressing, or using chemical extraction.

The result is a golden oil with a gentle, nutty flavour. It's available in both refined and non-refined forms. Generally, refined rapeseed oil is more affordable than non-refined or cold-pressed varieties.
